Bottom Shelf News is a crowd-sourced satirical news site. 

The titles in blue are the headlines of today's top news stories.

These are real news stories, but we can do better than the boring headlines they gave us. Submit a funny, clever, smart, or charmingly dumb version of a headline and the bottom shelf news community will decide on our favorite! 

The blue headlines are our users' submissions. You can vote on your favorites, or submit your own headline. 

Again, these are real news articles. If you want to use bottom shelf news as your only source of news, you can! We don't reccomend it.
